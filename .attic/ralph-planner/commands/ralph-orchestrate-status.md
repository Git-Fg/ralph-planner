# Ralph Orchestrate Status (DEPRECATED - Use Built-in Status)

⚠️ **This command is deprecated.** Status is now displayed automatically in the Ralph Wiggum loop.

## Built-in Status
The Ralph Wiggum loop now shows status automatically each iteration:
- Current phase (planning/orchestration)
- Progress bars and goal progress
- Iteration count and elapsed time
- Type "stop" to halt gracefully

No separate status command needed!

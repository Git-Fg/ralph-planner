# Ralph Goals Init (DEPRECATED - Auto-conversion in Ralph Wiggum Loop)

⚠️ **This command is deprecated.** Goals.xml is now auto-created within the Ralph Wiggum loop.

## Migration
Use `/ralph-planner-start` instead:

```
/ralph-planner-start
```

This provides:
- ✓ Automatic conversion from planning to goals.xml
- ✓ Hybrid mode (planning → orchestration)
- ✓ Built-in status display

The Ralph Wiggum loop automatically converts planning artifacts to goals.xml when planning is complete.
